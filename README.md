## ✅ FEATURES

### Match Management
- Match list: upcoming soonest first, played newest first
- Match cockpit: team names, date, status, quick-edit icon
- Create/edit via unified modal — team & championship dropdowns
- Time management: start/stop halves, halftime popup, end match
- Score controls with goal scorer modal (player grid + own goal + assists)
- Goal removal modal
- Retroactive goal entry for ended matches
- Resources panel: **Табло**, **Заставка**, **Команда**, **Статистика**, **Трансляция**

### Clip Markers
- "📍 Отметить момент" button appears only while a half is playing
- Saves `{ matchId, timestamp, matchTime, half }` to `/clips` Firebase node
- Clip log shown during match (with delete) and after match ends (read-only review)
- Useful for finding highlight moments in the recording later

### Firebase Bandwidth Optimisation
- `.once()` replaces collection real-time listener; per-field listeners for live updates
- `_matchDataCache` serves cockpit with zero reads after initial load
- Team logos fetched from `/teams/{id}`, never stored in match records
- Session caches throughout: `_teamsCache`, `_playersPageCache`, `_coachCache`, `_champTeamsCache`

### Goal Tracking & Assists
- Live goal modal: assist section above scorer grid, multi-select, modal stays open
- Assist picker modal on every goal stats row
- `assists: [{playerId, playerNumber}]` array on goal records

### Championships
- Championship Stats Modal: W/D/L, goals for/against, ⚽/👟 toggle, medals, warning banner
- Championship thumbnail (2560×1440)
- `isPassed` toggle hides from match form

### Roster Management
- Player CRUD with photo upload, absent toggle, soft delete
- Coach management with photo
- Badge icons (goalkeeper/field/coach PNG)
- Roster thumbnail (2560×1440) — dark header band matching match thumbnail style

### Thumbnails
- **Match thumbnail** — 1920×1080 canvas, team logos, VS or score, date, championship
- **Roster thumbnail** — 2560×1440, player cards, coach, GK section
- **Championship thumbnail** — 2560×1440, card grid ≤15 / table >15

## 📺 STREAMING WIDGETS

### `widget.html` — Live Scoreboard
Real-time score + timer for OBS. Goal notification card (5s):
- Home player: `#N | Гол! / LASTNAME | ⚽` (+ assist line if assists)
- Opponent: team 2 logo (or ⚽) | "Гол!" + team name | ⚽
- Own goal: team 1 logo | "Автогол" + "Автогол команды {team2Name}" | ⚽

### `goals-widget.html` — Goal Statistics
Table (≤10 goals) or card grid (>10). Assist chips in table, assist badge in cards.

### `broadcast-widget.html` — Automated Broadcast Director
Full-screen 1920×1080 widget for Larix/OBS. Automates the entire presentation:

1. **Load** — match thumbnail (15s) → roster thumbnail (15s) → transparent
2. **Half starts** — canvas/stats cleared **instantly** → score bottom-center (5s) → top-left
3. **Playing** — score widget top-left with live timer
4. **Goal** — goal card bottom-center (5s) → score bottom-center (3s) → top-left
5. **Half ends** — score bottom-center (3s) → stats full-screen (10s) → match thumbnail with score
6. **Next half starts** — thumbnail/stats cleared instantly → repeat from step 2

Score widget uses exact `widget.html` layout. Stats overlay: full-screen solid background, table ≤7 / cards >7.

**State machine design:** `playing` always wins — `bwHalfStart()` runs synchronously and instantly clears whatever is on screen before starting the score intro animation. No abort flags or sequence guards needed.
